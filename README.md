# Arduino Pomodoro Timer
A pomodoro timer for studying using arduino's LCD.

While working on something, I get distracted and maybe take a break randomly while working on the task at hand. On the other hand, I can get completely engrossed in what I’m working on and forget to take a break, which does not give my eyes and brain some rest. To prevent this bad habit, I can use the pomodoro technique. I will have 25 minutes of work time and 5 minutes of break time, and that counts as one interval. (Read more here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) 

I could just use a timer on the internet, but then I wouldn’t be able to know how much time is left on the pomodoro (because I would be on a different tab.) Furthermore, if I’m doing something (like kumon) that’s not on the laptop or computer, it will be of no use. Therefore, I decided to build one using arduino and its LCD display.
